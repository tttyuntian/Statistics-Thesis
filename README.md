# Welcome to LDA_Gibbs! 
This is my statistics research project about natural language processing with Dr. Nicole Dalzell at Wake Forest University. One of the main concentrations of this project is topic modeling and I focus on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with Gibbs sampling process. LDA is effective at classifying documents into latent topics. After digging into this algorithm, I have finished my own version of [*LDA_Gibbs.Rmd*](https://github.com/tttyuntian/Statistics-Thesis/blob/master/LDA_Gibbs.Rmd) in R. More information of this script will be shown below.

To learn about the theoretical part of LDA, you can read through Section 3 of my thesis paper [*A Brief Introduction to Natural Language Processing.pdf*](https://github.com/tttyuntian/Statistics-Thesis/blob/master/A%20Brief%20Introduction%20to%20Natural%20Language%20Processing.pdf). 

# LDA_Gibbs Introduction
LDA_Gibbs is an easy-to-use function that can classify documents into latent topics.
